# Natural Language Processing

This repository illustrates how different natural language techniques can be applied in a variety of scenarios. These projects follow a tutorial-like approach, where the implementation details are thoroughly discussed alongside with the code.

## Projects

* [POS Tagging, Syntactic Dependency Parsing and NER](./POS%20Tagging%20and%20NER.ipynb)
<br><br>
Part-of-speech tagging (POS), syntactic dependency parsing and named entity recognition (NER) with **spaCy**. <br><br>
This notebook can be better visualized on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/j-n-t/natural_language_processing/blob/master/POS%20Tagging%20and%20NER.ipynb).
<br><br>

* [Sentiment Analysis](./Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)
<br><br>
Sentiment analysis of 10 000 Amazon reviews with a **rule-based algorithm (VADER)** and a **machine learning model**.
<br><br>

* [Text Classification with Classical ML](./Text%20Classification.ipynb)
<br><br>
Text classification of movie reviews from the polarity dataset v2.0 using different approaches. Creation of a **custom text normalization transformer and a custom gensim vectorization transformer** to be used in a **scikit-learn pipeline**. Testing of **different classifiers**.
<br><br>

* [Text Classification with Neural Networks](./Text%20Classification%20with%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)
<br><br>
Text classification of movie reviews from the large movie review dataset using **artifical neural networks** - creation of **9 different architectures** with **Keras**. Evaluation and comparison of the performance of the **different classifiers**.
<br><br>

* [Topic Modeling](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/j-n-t/natural_language_processing/blob/02e845395f8654ac642ec418674a5bb1b2543326/Topic%20Modeling.ipynb)
<br><br>
 Assigning over 400 000 quora questions to different categories, or topics, with **three different methods: LDA, LSA and NMF**. A double approach to LDA: the gensim way and the scikit-learn way. **Topic visualization with pyLDAvis**.
<br><br>

* [Question Answering](./Question%20Answering.ipynb)
<br><br>
Answering some simple questions with **Keras**.
